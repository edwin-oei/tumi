This project aims to semi-automate the event registration process.

At the heart of this project is the sign up tool (signUp.py). Potential participants simply have to come to the office and display their QR code which contains their email address. The user of this tool then takes the money and confirms the registration of said participant. An e-receipt will be automatically sent to the participant and the records in the database modified accordingly.
